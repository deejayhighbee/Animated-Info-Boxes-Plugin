Overview:
The Animated Info Boxes Plugin is a lightweight, responsive WordPress tool that enables users to create and display eye-catching, animated info boxes. Each info box features a customizable cover and back side with smooth transition animations, offering a modern, interactive way to showcase content. The plugin is built around a custom post type and uses custom meta boxes for complete control over content and styling.

Purpose:
I was looking for a lightweight, elegant way to showcase continent information on my postal code database website (postalcode.pro). Since I couldn’t find a simple solution—and I didn’t want to burden the site with a bulky website builder like Elementor—I decided to develop a custom plugin to handle it.

Key Features:
Custom Post Type & Meta Boxes:
The plugin registers a custom post type called “aib_box” (Info Box) that lets users easily add and manage multiple info boxes. The meta box interface includes fields for description, link text and URL, background color, gradient overlays, background image, and custom title and description colors.
